Remarks:
- Image batches have shape [batch_size, channel_count, height, width]
- We don't use padding for this dataset
- Because of the low pixel count, stride is going to be 1 for all conv layers
- Because of the low pixel count, kernel size will stay 5x5 for all conv layers
- A single channel image is flattened according to: 
    len(x) = (height*width-kernel_size)/(stride) + 1
- With multiple channels, the flattening becomes:
    len(x) = [(height*width-kernel_size)/(stride) + 1]*channel_count
- Even single datapoints have a "batch dimension" that needs to be preserved
when processing, so DO NOT USE torch.flatten(), because it will eat the batch
dimension and break things.

Some experimental results:
- Downsizing the kernel to 3x3 from 5x5 significantly improved performance
- Additional hidden layers in the linear phase were expensive and not terribly
helpful; deepening the convolution seemed to work better
- Watch 1,3,7,9
